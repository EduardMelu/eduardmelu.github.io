                                                <h3>MEME</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Meme... a simple word, right? The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate, and evolve (memetics). The concept of the Internet meme was first proposed by Mike Godwin in the June 1993 issue of Wired.(Wikipedia)
                                                    But what is the relation between this word and the stock market? Well i've been trading for some time, about 6 years, i've tried it all. Back in the day the most risky segment was binary options, it went on the mentality all or nothing. Forex was fun,
                                                    a simple article or statement could've changed the price in an instant...but it had a logic behind it. I am not talking now about stock market manipulation or anything like that, just a regular example. 
                                                    We go through hard times right now, since we are in the heat of a global pandemic so a lot of people suffer from job loss, also school are closed so a lot of teens are home with a lot of free time... also it appears that casinos are closed too :P but not rly.
                                                </p>

                                            <section>
                                                <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Well... Free time + some savings + internet = potential money. That is the equation everyone followed in order to make some money online. But the thing is the new trend of investors it's not based on any actual statistic or logic, it is all a meme =))
                                                    . Having a hard time to understand how is this possible? Let me tell you, a stock does not reflect the actual worth of a company, it is a speculation of it's potential, but also the amount of trades that are shared - this means the hype. A meme trader 
                                                    is a person who trades some stock based on an incredible logic? Why not , it's the new thing ! That's all... in small quantities they are harmless but if we add a facebook, whatsapp or even reddit, where everything happends fast...well this is dangerous.
                                                    A meme trader just rides the uptrend..some fall..some wins but it's all fun and it's all for a meme.

                                                <h3>Case Study</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                    Let's take HERTZ - HTZ for example: Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. provides car rental services. It operates as a vehicle rental business globally through its Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty car rental brands. The company operates through the following segments: U.S. Rental Car, International Rental Car, and All Other Operations. The U.S. Rental Car segment deals with rental of vehicles, as well as sales of ancillary products and services in the U.S. The International Rental Car segment provides rental and leasing of vehicles, as well as sales of ancillary products and services internationally.
                                                    It was heavily impacted by pandemic and also on the blink of bankruptcy... article 11. A stock that it was doomed to fail...so nothing appealing to invest
                                                    AND WHAT HAPPEND ? MEME my friends... from a price of a share was 0.56 on 26/05/2020 it went up all the way to 5.53 8/06/2020 . Where is the logic? Robin Hood my friends ... the word HTZ had way over 100000 searches in that period. One guy made 100 dolars, he tells his dad, friends and so on... everyone is in on a stock that is going bankrupt...crazy right ? That's meme trading

                                                    Nothing...Rly nothing...Just watch the trend and be carefull on your investment...Also try to watch out for the meme stock.. it can make you rich.
