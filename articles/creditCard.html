                                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                                <p>The topic has been intensely discussed over the years, because of the
                                                    high demand in the banking industry. There are a lot of solutions that
                                                    have incredible results. Over the years solutions using deep learning
                                                    methods, artificial neural network, random forests or logistic
                                                    regression were implemented, but we will focus only focus on the
                                                    comparison between the algorithms that implement the idea of
                                                    binary classification. The most important aspect would be the
                                                    comparison between the most respected algorithms like decision tree
                                                    (of course boosted), logistic regression, and artificial neural
                                                    network. The dataset will be taken from real life cases in order to be
                                                    more precise.
                                                    The humanity goes through hard times because of the global
pandemic. The lockdown broke the spirit of so many people and whole
businesses moved online, including shops. This is a good thing but also a
bad thing since the most common method of payment is a credit card. In
the previous years we have seen how credit card fraud increased drastically
since so many businesses migrated online. The fig1. Shows the evolution
of credit card fraud over the years, this being the number one method for
identity thief. In addition to the increased number of online payments
comes the new trend of paying with google pay or other similar apps. This
is very convenient since you don't use the physical card and it's super
comfy. But the problem comes when we think that this is a possibility due
to the NFC technology and it could be easily attacked using a card cloner.
Fig1. Cred card fraud evolution
I know the idea is scary but we must face it...it's a reality and it is affecting
people's lives having an incredible impact on their financial status and on
their technology trust. The Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS) has reported that gross losses due to credit card fraud have risen
steadily from £122 million in 1997 to £40.3 million in 2010 in the United
Kingdom [2]. This is why this was such an important problem and why it
received so much attention from the academic society </p>

                                                    <h3>A Review</h3>
                                                    <p>Credit card fraud detection is a discussed and important topic which
                                                        has received a lot of attention from the academic world. And this is not a
                                                        new thing. For example, in 1997 Ginel, Cruz and Dorronsoro had created
                                                        a fraud detection system that was built online and was based on a neural
                                                        classifier. Also, McDonald and Bell in 1996 have created a system that was
                                                        based on logit techniques but since then the problem continued to exist and
                                                        become even more severe. So not only the academic world was involved
                                                        but also the governments. And in the paper [2] there is a more detailed list
                                                        based on the article, method and also the country. The most used
                                                        techniques were based on binary classification using neural networks,
                                                        Bayesian methods, decision trees </p>

                                                <h3>Binary Classification Methods</h3>
                                                <p>As we have seen from Fig2 the most used methods for solving this
                                                    problem are binary classification methods so we will focus on that. But
                                                    also after reading the findings of papers [1][4] I chose to focus on the
                                                    comparison and of three methods: artificial neural network, decision trees,
                                                    and logistic regression. 
                                                    3.1 Data Set
                                                    A crucial part for the success of a machine learning algorithm
                                                    is the data itself. This time the article [1] suggests the use of data that
                                                    comes from real-time transactions and the history database with
                                                    more than 40 fields. This should be easily applied to any bank that
                                                    is why this schema was chosen. From all records about 0.07% are
                                                    frauds so this means the set is imbalanced so it would clearly need a
                                                    pre-processing. So the values that were missing were ignored, log
                                                    transformation was applied, and the key variables were extracted
                                                    leaving with the Fig3 table of variables.
                                                    This problem had many solutions, but we will focus on the
                                                    artificial neural network, logistic regression and decision tree.
                                                    So, we will start with neural networks that are formed by
                                                    grouping nodes into layers and connecting these layers with some
                                                    interconnections that have different weighted values. The problem
                                                    with this as the paper [5] proves it: " illogical weightings of the
                                                    indicators and overfitting in the training stage both of which
                                                    negatively impacts predictive accuracy.".
                                                    However, it was still used because it is considered better in the pure
                                                    theoretical aspect than a classical statistical method in the fraud
                                                    detection application.
                                                    Decision tree is a classic and easy to understand method that
                                                    have the power to deal with constant data. The main perfect decision
                                                    tree would be a tree with high precision and small scale. The reason
                                                    it would be a perfect match for the credit card problem is that is very
                                                    flexible because of its non-parameter method and also it is
                                                    explainable.
                                                    Logistic Regression comes in handy when dealing with data
                                                    where we want to predict if a certain characteristic is present or not
                                                    based on a set of predictor variables. </p>

                                                    <h3>Experimental Results</h3>
                                                    <p>The data for training and tested was composed of transactions from
                                                        2006 and data from 2005 just for testing. The metric used to measure the
                                                        performance was lift since it is commonly used on classification
                                                        application. In lift metric the data its's sorted in descended order by the
                                                        posterior probabilities and then dividing records into deciles. The
                                                        transactions are placed into a category based on their response. In the left
                                                        column there are out deciles with 0.1 corresponding to the highest
                                                        responder. The average response rate is 0.07% .
                                                        Fig4. The results from paper in lift [1]
                                                        In fig4 we can see the actual results from the experiment. We notice
                                                        that in the highest lift is located in the top decile and it is given by an
                                                        artificial neural network 5.88, followed by the logit regression 5.84 and
                                                        decision trees with 3.89. and with the lift chart from fig5 we can be sure 
                                                        that the neural network is the best one in lift metric followed by logit
                                                        regression and in the end decision trees.
                                                        Fig5. Lift chart [1]
                                                        However, in the paper [6] it is shown that decision trees are
                                                        mentioned in 19 articles even though their performance in lift metric
                                                        is not so good, while the logit regression it's mentioned 8 times. The
                                                        king still is an artificial neural network with 20 articles describing
                                                        this solution. In the same study it is proven that both artificial neural
                                                        network and decision trees have medium accuracy medium coverage
                                                        but high cost in contrast with logistic regression that possess 100%
                                                        true positive accuracy and medium coverage and cost.
                                                        The lift metric was used because we wanted to test the performance
                                                        of the model itself. Also, since the data was imbalanced even after
                                                        pre-processing then this was the correct result. The formula for lift
                                                        calculus is quite simple: lift = (predicted rate / average rate)</p>

                                                    <p>Credit card fraud is a real problem that can cause so many problems
                                                        and it should be stopped at any costs. As we've seen the number of articles
                                                        trying to deliver a solution is incredible showing the implication of
                                                        researchers. The most used method is an artificial neural network which
                                                        shows incredible results in lift metrics. But logistic regression and decision
                                                        trees both have its advantages. In the following years we may see a rise in
